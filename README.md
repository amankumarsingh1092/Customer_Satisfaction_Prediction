# Customer_Satisfaction_Prediction
# 📋Overview
This project aims to predict customer satisfaction ratings using a dataset of customer support tickets for various tech products. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) in Python.
# 📁 Dataset
- "customer_support_tickets.csv" includes features such as:
  - Ticket Type
  - Product Purchased
  - Customer Age & Gender
  - Ticket Priority
  - Channel
  - Time to Resolution
  - Customer Satisfaction Rating (target variable)

# 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for ML)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, missing values)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training & Evaluation
5. Visualization of Results

## 📈 Model Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- Accuracy, classification report, and feature importance used for evaluation

## 📌 Insights
- Top dissatisfaction causes include refund and billing issues.
- High priority and technical issues affect satisfaction the most.
- Age and product types influence satisfaction levels.
