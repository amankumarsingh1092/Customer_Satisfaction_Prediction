# Customer_Satisfaction_Prediction
# Overview
This project aims to predict customer satisfaction ratings using a dataset of customer support tickets for various tech products. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) in Python.
# Dataset
- "customer_support_tickets.csv" includes features such as:
  - Ticket ID
  - Customer (Name, Email, Age, Gender)
  - Product Purchased
  - Date of Purchase
  - Ticket (Type, Subject, Description, Status, Resolution, Priority, Channel)
  - First Response Time
  - Time to Resolution
  - Customer Satisfaction Rating 

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for ML)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, missing values)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training & Evaluation
5. Visualization of Results

## Model Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- Accuracy, classification report, and feature importance used for evaluation
## Model Outputs & Visualizations
